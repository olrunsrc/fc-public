<h1>latchTest (MASON)<br>
</h1>
<br>
This library was created to test a new attribute of action selection
inspired by the emotion &amp; drive durative state systems in
animals.&nbsp; It relies on the BOD/MASON library, and it was for this
that POSH/profiler.py and exp_executer.py were written.&nbsp; As a
consequence, both of those files are (as of this writing) possibly too
dependent on BOD/MASON and may need further fixing if to be used in
another context.<br>
<br>
This library has associated publications on action selection
(Rohlfshagen &amp; Bryson 2008).<br>
<br>
This library was written by Philipp Rohlfshagen in the Autumn of 2007,
based on the earlier macque library written by Hagen Lehmann.&nbsp;
Both Rohlfshagen and Lehmann were employed by the University of Bath
and funded by <em>The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council (EPSRC)</em>, Grant <a

Durative Variable state on the Design and Control of Action
Selection''; Joanna J Bryson (University of Bath) PI.<br>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>
Most files are `standard' behaviours, similar to the other libraries.
In fact, most of the work was initially based upon the library
`macaques'. The most crucial differences are:<br>
<br>
- Most behaviours inherit from the class Latch, that automatically
allows a state to be latched. The constructor takes several arguments
that allow to model different latches. See for more documentation below.<br>
- The behaviour is now subclasses simply by calling the constructor. It
is no longer required to pass the list <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The behaviours are as follows:<br>

<h2>Talk to PR about...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Why wants_to_interrupt looks at current_state &lt; 20 rather than
_inter?&nbsp; Should that method just be deleted?</li>
  <li>Document interrupt.py -- this is just for the experiments,
right&nbsp; Is everything you really need in POSH/latch.py</li>
</ul>
