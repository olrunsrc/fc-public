<h1>Sheep / Dog Demo&nbsp; (SPOSH version)<br>
</h1>
<br>
This is an example BOD/MASON library built for the strict slip-stack
(SPOSH) version of BOD.&nbsp; SPOSH is a version of POSH written
by Jan Drugowitsch, inspired by the earliest version of POSH
(previously available only in archaic C++).&nbsp; In contrast,
scheduled POSH includes extra cognitive state, and is therefore
slower.&nbsp; The scheduled POSH version of the basic version of this
demo is included in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mason</span>
directory.<br>
<br>
This library has not been used for
any experiments, just for developing BOD/MASON.&nbsp; It has been
described a little by Bryson, Caulfield and Drugowitsch (2006).&nbsp;
See for another example library <span style="font-weight: bold;">latch
Test</span>, which has associated publications on action selection
(Rohlfshagen &amp; Bryson 2008).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This library was first developed by Tristain Caulfield for EASSS in
July 2005.&nbsp; Tristan was primarily trying to connect jyPOSH (by
Andy
Kwong) to MASON and never really worked with or understood BOD.&nbsp;
It was updated for the new versions of BOD/MASON by Jan Drugowitsch in
2006-7.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is being improved for better behavior
decomposition (and better behaviour!) by Joanna Bryson in 2008.<br>
<br>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
There are two types of agents distributed randomly around the field ---
sheep and dogs.&nbsp; In Tristan's version (which is the default), the
dogs just chase the
sheep.&nbsp; The sheep flock (see Reynolds 1987).&nbsp; They also panic
(see Delgado Mata &amp; Aylett 2005), which means they move closer to
each other when they
either sense a predator or sense that the other sheep are
panicked.&nbsp; The flocking exploits some of the underlying MASON
routines for flocking.<br>
<br>
In the new version the dogs &amp; sheep share some behaviors, which is
what a behavior library is supposed to be about:&nbsp; code
reuse.&nbsp; But they are still very different.&nbsp; The dogs now
flock too, but with the sheep as well as each other.&nbsp; And the
smarter sheep not only pull together, but also run away from the dogs,
so the dogs herd them more effectively.&nbsp; To see the newer, smarter
behaviour, you need to use the init_smarter_beasts agent init file,
instead of just the default init_agents.<br>
<br>
The next time I feel like I have time to play with this, I'll use the
latching demonstrated in latch test to make the dogs go off &amp; look
for strays.<br>
<br>
There is <a

complete documentation of this demo online</a> (including suggestions
for extending the demo &amp; teaching yourself BOD/MASON), although
that page is now a bit out of date.<br>
