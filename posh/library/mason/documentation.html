<h1>Sheep / Dog Demo --- Scheduled POSH<br>
</h1>
<br>
<br>
This is an example of a BOD/MASON library built for scheduled
POSH.&nbsp; Scheduled POSH is based on SoL (Bryson &amp;
Th&oacute;risson 1999).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This library has not been used for
any experiments, just for developing BOD/MASON.&nbsp; It has been
described a little by Bryson, Caulfield and Drugowitsch (2006).&nbsp;
The library <span style="font-weight: bold;">sheepDogDemo</span>
contains the SPOSH version of this demo, with some further
extensions.&nbsp; See for another example library <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">latch
Test</span>, which has associated publications on action selection
(Rohlfshagen &amp; Bryson 2008).<br>
<br>
This library was first developed by Tristain Caulfield for EASSS in
July 2005.&nbsp; Tristan was primarily trying to conect jyPOSH (by Andy
Kwong) to MASON and never really worked with or understood BOD.&nbsp;
It was updated for the new versions of BOD/MASON by Jan Drugowitsch in
2006-7.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is being improved for better behavior
decomposition (and better behaviour!) by Joanna Bryson in 2008.<br>
<br>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
There are two types of agents distributed randomly around the field ---
sheep and dogs.&nbsp; In Tristan's version, the dogs just chase the
sheep.&nbsp; The sheep flock (see Reynolds 1987).&nbsp; They also panic
(see Aylett 199?), which means they move closer to each other when they
either sense a predator or sense that the other sheep are paniced.<br>
<br>
I am making a new version where both the sheep and the dogs flock, so
it is more clear that different agents can share behaviors in the
behavior library.&nbsp; This will also make the dogs behave less
stupidly.&nbsp; The difference is that the dogs flock with both dogs
and sheep, but don't panic and have a larger avoidance value so they
generally wind up on the outside of the herd.&nbsp; Meanwhile the sheep
don't see the dogs as flock-mates, they see them as predators, so they
panic.&nbsp; Panic should be represented with a flexi-latch to
demonstrate the emotion drive thing.&nbsp; If I have time, I will also
add a behaviour to the dogs where they chase strays.&nbsp; There may be
a drive to look for strays which would then really demo flexi-latch and
the drive/emotion commonality.<br>

<h2>Talk to Jan about...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>List of / doc for actions accessable through MASON class
(probably in MASON docs somewhere...)</li>
  <li>How to deprecate old versions of libraries if you aren't linked
to them (can you put them in "old"?)</li>
  <li>why does it try to validate before having read everything in --
what if two competences refer to each other?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Talk to PR about...</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Why wants_to_interrupt looks at current_state &lt; 20 rather than
_inter?&nbsp; Should that method just be deleted?</li>
  <li>Document interrupt.py -- this is just for the experiments,
right&nbsp; Is everything you really need in POSH/latch.py</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bugs!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Regular POSH doesn't support different priority levels for
elements in Competences!</li>
  <li>ABODE doesn't support Drives calling Actions.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
