<h1>Creating API documentation
</h1>
<p>API documentation can be created using <a
 href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">EpyDoc</a>.
</p>
<p>EpyDoc (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/) automatically generates
Python class
and module documentation based on importing the modules and
investigating
each class. EpyDoc is based on Python and does not support Jython.
As many of the modules in this project import Java classes, import in
Python would fail. That prohibits EPyDoc to generate documentation for
the classes in those modules.
</p>
<p>The stubs provided here allow Python to import the modules
correctly.
They won't run, but that's not required for generating the
documentation.
Hence, by using this path in the PYTHONPATH, one can use EpyDoc for
automated class documentation.<br>
</p>
<p>Important note:&nbsp; If you write new java code e.g. in
platform_files/MASON, you have to ensure you edit the .py documentation
files to keep this system working.&nbsp; If anyone knows another
documentation system that does work correctly with jython, please let
us know!
</p>
<p>The following steps generate the documentation in Linux (and
probably
also on OS X), given that Epydoc is installed correctly:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a console, go to the project root.&nbsp; Let us assume for
now, that the project root is at /home/user/src/jyposh.</li>
  <li>Create the PYTHONPATH environment variable that it points to the
project root and to the stubs root. In our example that would be (given
that you are using bash): <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"> export
PYTHONPATH=/home/user/src/jyposh:/home/user/src/jyposh/doc/stubs</span><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Run Epydoc to generate the documentation. More details about how
to class Epydoc to generate different forms of the documentation can be
found in the Epydoc documentation. We will generate HTML documentation
in the 'doc' folder: <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"> epydoc -o doc POSH </span><br>
    <br>
As given above, Epydoc has to be run in the project root. Otherwise it
won't find the files. The above command only documents the API of the
POSH implementations. To create additional documentation for, say, the
MASON library, use something like <br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"> epydoc -o doc POSH
library/mason/mason.py</span> </li>
</ol>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Happy documenting!
